**Overview:**
TripSphere is a simple and user-friendly travel planning website. It helps people to plan trips, choose how they want to travel (like flight or train), and give feedback about their experience. This website is built using ASP.NET Core MVC with C#, and the database is managed using SQL Server. The entire website is hosted online using Microsoft Azure, so it is easy to access anytime and from anywhere.

**Notable Technical Challenges & Solutions**


While working on the Trip Sphere project, we faced some technical problems, but we also learned how to solve them step by step. One big challenge was deploying the project to Microsoft Azure. At first, our app was not connecting to the database properly. We solved this by updating the correct connection string in the appsettings. Production. Json file and setting the right values in the Azure portal.
We also had issues with foreign key relationships in our database. For example, linking travel feedback with travel plans was not working. We fixed this by checking the model classes and using proper foreign key annotations. Then we ran migrations again, and everything started working fine.
Another problem came from Razor Views not showing correctly. This happened because some view file names didn‚Äôt match the controller action names. We followed the correct MVC naming rules and organized the files properly, which fixed the issue.
Since we were working in a team, we also had some GitHub merge conflicts when two people worked on the same file. To handle this, we created separate branches, used pull requests, and discussed changes regularly to avoid conflicts.
We also found it a little tricky to use external APIs like NewsAPI. It took time to understand how to fetch data and show it in our Razor pages. We learned to use HttpClient, read the JSON response, and display it using models.
Finally, we noticed that our website was not mobile-friendly in the beginning. Some pages didn‚Äôt look good on phones. So, we used Bootstrap‚Äôs grid system and media queries to make the site responsive and work well on all screen sizes.
